- [**Status**](https://github.com/EnigmaSoft/Status) - Server Status to show in what state your GameServer is in.
- [**Character**](https://github.com/EnigmaSoft/Character) - To switch & display your *Main Character*.

## Security
EnigmaCMS is currently in development, this repository is of the Prototype we develop, **DO NOT** use this in production as this is absolutely **not secured**. It is merely to gather and implement the ideas for features and packages required for the official CMS release. It is currently not secured, not organized and absolutely not a *"polished"* product!

## Contact
If you have any ideas for Features, let us know and we may add it to the list.
